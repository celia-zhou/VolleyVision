# VolleyVision

RPM Sand is a premier youth beach volleyball club based in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Currently, it is the third-ranked beach volleyball club in the United States of America and has produced many successful players, including several high school and collegiate All-American players as well as a 2021 Olympian. In beach volleyball, a highly important component of player improvement is the ability to track and analyze previous tournaments in order to determine points of potential improvement. As a result, RPM is seeking a web application that will help them study game video.

On a high level, our product/project, VolleyVision, is a web application that records the statistics and breaks down playthroughs of beach volleyball matches. VolleyVision focuses on solving the client’s aim to be able to simply track and analyze volleyball game statistics through a single platform. We will also implement a feature that helps easily connect players with college coaches and recruiters.
